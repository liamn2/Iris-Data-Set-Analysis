<b><h1>Iris Data Set Project</h1></b> by <b>Liam Nutley</b>
The Iris Data set is a collection of petal and sepal widths and lengths of three different flowers, namely; Iris Versicolor, Iris Setosa and Iris Virginica. 50 of each flower type were measured and the results taken. 
For this project, I was tasked with taking this data set and creating the following three programs. 
1. I had to write the summarised data set to a new output text file.
2. I had to produce histograms of the various entries as .png files.
3. I had to produce scatter plots from the variables.

For the first part of the project, I immported the pandas funtion into my code to make use of its read_to_csv function as I had converted my text data set into a .csv file. I then simply out the contents of the .csv file into a new text document called output.txt

For the second part, I imported the NumPy function to read the .csv file of the data entries, and to output histograms of the variables.

Finally, for the third part of the project, I imported the matplotlib.pyplot function into my code to read the .csv file and produce appropriate scatterplots of the variables.
